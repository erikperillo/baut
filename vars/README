this is where you can store your vars description files.
every vars file must be in format csv, delimited by commas, in the following format:

what is a var? a var is a system variable. benchmarking something can be thought of as simply
measuring variables on the system that were altered by your application, e.g. a performance 
counter. if you want, for instance, to get the value of the file ~/foo after you program is run,
you can get it by making a command (e.g. cat ~/foo) and putting it in the setter field. it is 
analogous for setters. 

name,getter,setter,file_pattern

name is the name of the variable. it must be unique.
getter is a command by which you will set your variable. output MUST be done via stdout.
setter is a command by which you will modify your variable. the first argument of the command 
must be the value that you want to set.
file_pattern is a useful field in the case your program produces files that are to be parsed.
if they match the pattern and are stored in the directory of the run, a file with the name "name"
will be created, where every line is the result of the command "setter" applied to every matched
file name.
